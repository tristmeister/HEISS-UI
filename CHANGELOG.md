# Changelog

Every release of HEISS UI, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as described in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#versions-and-releases).

Add notes under **Unreleased** as changes land; `npm run release` turns that
section into the next version and uses it as the GitHub release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Models that can only redraw a picture (Krea 2, SDXL, Flux, Z-Image and the
  other built-in image models) now offer **Add start image** instead of Add
  reference, and a Change slider next to the image sets how much it may change.

### Fixed
- Models, text encoders and VAEs in folders added through ComfyUI's
  `extra_model_paths.yaml` (a shared model drive, an A1111 install) were
  never read, so HEISS could not tell what they were. It now reads every
  folder ComfyUI loads from.
- A reference image added to a built-in model was ignored, even at 0%
  change. The composer could show a reference restored from a draft or a
  model switch that it then never sent; it now sends what it shows, and the
  server accepts a bare image id too.
- The workflow menu showed the gallery through its top half instead of frosted
  glass, and the Add reference chip clashed with prompt text running under it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-23

The first tagged release of HEISS UI, a local studio for ComfyUI, built on
[J-AI Studio](https://github.com/jasperdevs/J-AI-Studio) by jasperdevs. These
notes cover everything that changed since the fork.

### Highlights

- **Drop in a model and go.** HEISS reads each model file's weights to tell what
  it is: 16 image and 5 video families, from SD 1.5 to Krea 2, Wan 2.2 and
  MiniMax H3. It uses the settings the model's makers recommend and pairs it with
  a matching text encoder and VAE, or downloads one for you.
- **Smart upscale.** One click on a finished image runs SeedVR2 at Fast,
  Balanced or High effort, with an optional face pass and a before/after slider.
  A guided setup installs everything it needs.
- **LoRAs.** A searchable library grouped by folder, stacks saved per
  model family, favorites, recents, drag to reorder and undo.
- **Private Vault.** Encrypt chosen generations, their prompts and settings
  behind a password.
- **Prebuilt downloads.** Unzip, double-click Start HEISS UI, done: about 30 MB
  of runtime packages, no build step.

### Added

#### Models
- 21 model families recognised from the weights: SD 1.5, SD 2.x, SDXL (Pony,
  Illustrious/NoobAI, v-pred, Lightning, DMD2, Hyper, Turbo), Pony V7, SD 3.5,
  Flux.1 (dev, schnell, de-distilled), Flux.2 Dev and Klein 4B/9B, Chroma,
  HiDream, Qwen-Image (incl. 2512 and 2.1), Z-Image, Krea 2, Anima, Wan 2.1,
  Wan 2.2 5B, the Wan 2.2 14B high/low-noise pair, HunyuanVideo 1.5 and
  MiniMax H3.
- Each family runs with the settings from its official templates and model
  cards, including Turbo/Base and Raw variants, clip skip for Pony and
  Illustrious, and v-prediction for NoobAI merges.
- All-in-one checkpoints and model-only files both work. HEISS sees which parts
  a checkpoint carries and fills the rest from compatible installed files,
  preferring abliterated text encoders.
- Missing text encoders or VAEs are named with a one-click download into
  ComfyUI's folders.
- One text encoder picker per slot, and a "Built into the checkpoint" VAE option.
- A "Use as" picker in Settings for files HEISS can't identify, including the
  variant.

#### Smart upscale
- SeedVR2 upscaling from any finished image at Fast, Balanced or High effort,
  with an optional face detail pass. The original is always kept.
- A compare slider in the viewer: drag, double-click to centre, or use the arrow
  keys. Zoom and pan keep working while comparing.
- A guided setup: install the nodes through ComfyUI Manager or one terminal
  command (macOS, Linux, PowerShell, Command Prompt), download the model with
  resume and checksum checks, then upscale the image you clicked.
- A download widget with percent, speed and time left while setup runs.
- A popover that says why an image can't be upscaled.

#### LoRAs
- A LoRA library grouped by nested folders, with search, favorites, recents and
  suggestions for the current model family.
- Stacks saved per model family, shown as chips; one click loads a stack.
- Cards with an on/off switch, a strength slider, drag-to-reorder (keyboard too)
  and remove with undo, plus All off and Clear.
- Warnings for LoRAs missing from ComfyUI or past a workflow's limit.

#### Reference and start images
- A reference library in the composer with an Uploads tab and pointer-aware
  drops; the chosen image survives a reload.
- Workflows can let a reference image set the output size and aspect.
- A bundled Flux 2 image-edit workflow.

#### Workflows
- A thumbnail workflow gallery with search, an image/video switch, favorites,
  filters and a detail panel listing missing nodes.
- Two-step import that previews name, type, family, status and control mapping
  before saving. Drop JSON files anywhere on the gallery.

#### Studio
- Private Vault: password-protected, encrypted storage for chosen generations
  and their prompts and settings, with backup export.
- An About page with version, update check, credits and local stats: outputs,
  render time, megapixels, streaks and most-used workflow.
- Output folder tools: Browse, automatic detection and live checking.
- Gallery bundles that group runs.
- A clear offline state with Retry, and deep links from errors to the right
  settings.
- Better layout on phones and in Safari.

### Changed

- Rebranded to HEISS UI, with a new website, mark and wordmark. Settings saved
  under the old J-AI names are still read.
- The studio is rebuilt around the generation composer: no top bar, a compact
  dock, and one frosted glass, control size and radius throughout.
- Every dialog uses one modal; settings live in seven sections (General,
  Generation, Upscale, Library, Privacy, Connection, About).
- Generation previews resolve from a pixel mosaic and show step and elapsed time.
- Gallery thumbnails are small WebP images, about 20 times lighter.
- Geist replaces Inter; the ember accent now only marks status and heat.
- Toasts appear top centre and above dialogs.
- Picking a workflow of the other type switches between image and video.
- Escape leaves zen mode once nothing else is open.

### Fixed

- Generating and saving LoRA stacks over plain-HTTP LAN failed.
- LoRA edits could overwrite each other across devices or be lost offline.
- A crash could wipe settings; files are now written atomically with a backup.
- A wrong output folder silently hid generations.
- FLUX.1 Krea was mistaken for Krea 2, and renamed fine-tunes went unrecognised.
- Toasts, dropdowns and tooltips sat under dialogs.
- The gallery flashed as every tile replayed its new-image animation.
- Offline workflow checks reported every node as missing.
- Built-in workflows could be deleted.
- Many smaller LoRA, upscale and layout issues.

### Removed

- The top bar and logo.
- The Workflows tab in Settings (moved into Library).
- The DarkBeast example workflow.
- Unused icon libraries and packages: the install is less than half the size.

### Under the hood

- Runtime needs only express, busboy and sharp: 32 MB for a release install,
  down from 563 MB of `node_modules`.
- `npm start` builds and repairs itself on first run.
- One graph builder for every model family.
- Semantic versioning, a changelog and `npm run release`; tagging publishes the
  download.
- 56 automated tests, run in CI.
